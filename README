I was missing the outputs for the compression and the common elements problems so I am not sure if this is what you requested. Took me about 15 minutes per exercize, could've been less even. 

The exam seemed a little bit off regarding format.

I didn't have time to work on an interface, sorry about that. I wasn't expecting the test so I was only able to schedule some minutes in between my work responsibilities.

I'd very much appreciate any feedback or inquiry
